You can add a sandbox by setting a system property, as shown in the example, or by adding `-Dognl.security.manager` to JVM arguments.\n\n\n```java\nimport ognl.Ognl;\nimport ognl.OgnlException;\n\npublic void evaluate(HttpServletRequest request, Object root) throws OgnlException {\n  String expression = request.getParameter(\"expression\");\n\n  // BAD: User provided expression is evaluated\n  Ognl.getValue(expression, root);\n  \n  // GOOD: The name is validated and expression is evaluated in sandbox\n  System.setProperty(\"ognl.security.manager\", \"\"); // Or add -Dognl.security.manager to JVM args\n  if (isValid(expression)) {\n    Ognl.getValue(expression, root);\n  } else {\n    // Reject the request\n  }\n}\n\npublic void isValid(Strig expression) {\n  // Custom method to validate the expression.\n  // For instance, make sure it doesn't include unexpected code.\n}\n\n```\n\n## References\n* Apache Commons: [Apache Commons OGNL](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-ognl/).\n* Struts security: [Proactively protect from OGNL Expression Injections attacks](https://struts.apache.org/security/#proactively-protect-from-ognl-expression-injections-attacks-if-easily-applicable).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-917](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/917.html).\n"

Also, if an exported activity is extending the `PreferenceActivity` class, make sure that the `isValidFragment` method is overriden and only returns `true` when the provided `fragmentName` points to an intended fragment.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following example shows two cases: in the first one, untrusted data is used to instantiate and add a fragment to an activity, while in the second one, a fragment is safely added with a static name.\n\n\n```java\npublic class MyActivity extends FragmentActivity {\n\n    @Override\n    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstance) {\n        try {\n            super.onCreate(savedInstance);\n            // BAD: Fragment instantiated from user input without validation\n            {\n                String fName = getIntent().getStringExtra(\"fragmentName\");\n                getFragmentManager().beginTransaction().replace(com.android.internal.R.id.prefs,\n                        Fragment.instantiate(this, fName, null)).commit();\n            }\n            // GOOD: Fragment instantiated statically\n            {\n                getFragmentManager().beginTransaction()\n                        .replace(com.android.internal.R.id.prefs, new MyFragment()).commit();\n            }\n        } catch (Exception e) {\n        }\n    }\n\n}\n\n```\nThe next example shows two activities that extend `PreferenceActivity`. The first activity overrides `isValidFragment`, but it wrongly returns `true` unconditionally. The second activity correctly overrides `isValidFragment` so that it only returns `true` when `fragmentName` is a trusted fragment name.\n\n\n```java\nclass UnsafeActivity extends PreferenceActivity {\n\n    @Override\n    protected boolean isValidFragment(String fragmentName) {\n        // BAD: any Fragment name can be provided.\n        return true;\n    }\n}\n\n\nclass SafeActivity extends PreferenceActivity {\n    @Override\n    protected boolean isValidFragment(String fragmentName) {\n        // Good: only trusted Fragment names are allowed.\n        return SafeFragment1.class.getName().equals(fragmentName)\n                || SafeFragment2.class.getName().equals(fragmentName)\n                || SafeFragment3.class.getName().equals(fragmentName);\n    }\n\n}\n\n\n```\n\n## References\n* Google Help: [How to fix Fragment Injection vulnerability](https://support.google.com/faqs/answer/7188427?hl=en).\n* IBM Security Systems: [Android collapses into Fragments](https://securityintelligence.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/android-collapses-into-fragments.pdf).\n* Android Developers: [Fragments](https://developer.android.com/guide/fragments)\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-470](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/470.html).\n",

            "markdown" : "# Cleartext storage of sensitive information in cookie\nSensitive information that is stored unencrypted is accessible to an attacker who gains access to the storage.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nEnsure that sensitive information is always encrypted before being stored. It may be wise to encrypt information before it is put into a heap data structure (such as `Java.util.Properties`) that may be written to disk later. Objects that are serializable or marshallable should also always contain encrypted information unless you are certain that they are not ever going to be serialized.\n\nIn general, decrypt sensitive information only at the point where it is necessary for it to be used in cleartext.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following example shows two ways of storing user credentials in a cookie. In the 'BAD' case, the credentials are simply stored in cleartext. In the 'GOOD' case, the credentials are hashed before storing them.\n\n\n```java\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n\t{\n\t\tString data;\n\t\tPasswordAuthentication credentials =\n\t\t\t\tnew PasswordAuthentication(\"user\", \"BP@ssw0rd\".toCharArray());\n\t\tdata = credentials.getUserName() + \":\" + new String(credentials.getPassword());\n\t\n\t\t// BAD: store data in a cookie in cleartext form\n\t\tresponse.addCookie(new Cookie(\"auth\", data));\n\t}\n\t\n\t{\n\t\tString data;\n\t\tPasswordAuthentication credentials =\n\t\t\t\tnew PasswordAuthentication(\"user\", \"GP@ssw0rd\".toCharArray());\n\t\tString salt = \"ThisIsMySalt\";\n\t\tMessageDigest messageDigest = MessageDigest.getInstance(\"SHA-512\");\n\t\tmessageDigest.reset();\n\t\tString credentialsToHash =\n\t\t\t\tcredentials.getUserName() + \":\" + credentials.getPassword();\n\t\tbyte[] hashedCredsAsBytes =\n\t\t\t\tmessageDigest.digest((salt+credentialsToHash).getBytes(\"UTF-8\"));\n\t\tdata = bytesToString(hashedCredsAsBytes);\n\t\t\n\t\t// GOOD: store data in a cookie in encrypted form\n\t\tresponse.addCookie(new Cookie(\"auth\", data));\n\t}\n}\n\n```\n\n## References\n* SEI CERT Oracle Coding Standard for Java: [SER03-J.

The authority part (the first path segment) of the URI, passed as parameter to the `ContentResolver`, determines which content provider is contacted for the operation. Specific operations that act on files also support the `file://` scheme, in which case the local filesystem is queried instead.

Such a string will force the regular expression engine to process each digit sequence once per digit in the sequence, again leading to a quadratic time complexity.\n\nTo make the processing faster, the regular expression should be rewritten such that the two `\\d+` sub-expressions do not have overlapping matches: `\"^0\\\\.\\\\d+(E\\\\d+)?$\"`.\n\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [Regular expression Denial of Service - ReDoS](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS).\n* Wikipedia: [ReDoS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReDoS).\n* Wikipedia: [Time complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity).\n* James Kirrage, Asiri Rathnayake, Hayo Thielecke: [Static Analysis for Regular Expression Denial-of-Service Attack](http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~hxt/research/reg-exp-sec.pdf).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-1333](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1333.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-730](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/730.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-400](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html).\n",

When the `Intent` is executed, it behaves as if it were run directly by the supplying application, using the privileges of that application.\n\nIf a `PendingIntent` is configured to be mutable, the fields of its internal `Intent` can be changed by the receiving application if they were not previously set.

            "text" : "# Query built from user-controlled sources\nIf a database query is built using string concatenation, and the components of the concatenation include user input, a user is likely to be able to run malicious database queries. This applies to various database query languages, including SQL and the Java Persistence Query Language.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nUsually, it is better to use a SQL prepared statement than to build a complete SQL query with string concatenation. A prepared statement can include a wildcard, written as a question mark (?), for each part of the SQL query that is expected to be filled in by a different value each time it is run. When the query is later executed, a value must be supplied for each wildcard in the query.\n\nIn the Java Persistence Query Language, it is better to use queries with parameters than to build a complete query with string concatenation. A Java Persistence query can include a parameter placeholder for each part of the query that is expected to be filled in by a different value when run. A parameter placeholder may be indicated by a colon (:) followed by a parameter name, or by a question mark (?) followed by an integer position. When the query is later executed, a value must be supplied for each parameter in the query, using the `setParameter` method. Specifying the query using the `@NamedQuery` annotation introduces an additional level of safety: the query must be a constant string literal, preventing construction by string concatenation, and the only way to fill in values for parts of the query is by setting positional parameters.\n\nIt is good practice to use prepared statements (in SQL) or query parameters (in the Java Persistence Query Language) for supplying parameter values to a query, whether or not any of the parameters are directly traceable to user input. Doing so avoids any need to worry about quoting and escaping.\n\n\n## Example\nIn the following example, the code runs a simple SQL query in two different ways.\n\nThe first way involves building a query, `query1`, by concatenating an environment variable with some string literals. The environment variable can include special characters, so this code allows for SQL injection attacks.\n\nThe second way, which shows good practice, involves building a query, `query2`, with a single string literal that includes a wildcard (`?`). The wildcard is then given a value by calling `setString`. This version is immune to injection attacks, because any special characters in the environment variable are not given any special treatment.\n\n\n```java\n{\n    // BAD: the category might have SQL special characters in it\n    String category = System.getenv(\"ITEM_CATEGORY\");\n    Statement statement = connection.createStatement();\n    String query1 = \"SELECT ITEM,PRICE FROM PRODUCT WHERE ITEM_CATEGORY='\"\n        + category + \"' ORDER BY PRICE\";\n    ResultSet results = statement.executeQuery(query1);\n}\n\n{\n    // GOOD: use a prepared query\n    String category = System.getenv(\"ITEM_CATEGORY\");\n    String query2 = \"SELECT ITEM,PRICE FROM PRODUCT WHERE ITEM_CATEGORY=?

            "markdown" : "# Query built from user-controlled sources\nIf a database query is built using string concatenation, and the components of the concatenation include user input, a user is likely to be able to run malicious database queries. This applies to various database query languages, including SQL and the Java Persistence Query Language.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nUsually, it is better to use a SQL prepared statement than to build a complete SQL query with string concatenation. A prepared statement can include a wildcard, written as a question mark (?), for each part of the SQL query that is expected to be filled in by a different value each time it is run. When the query is later executed, a value must be supplied for each wildcard in the query.\n\nIn the Java Persistence Query Language, it is better to use queries with parameters than to build a complete query with string concatenation. A Java Persistence query can include a parameter placeholder for each part of the query that is expected to be filled in by a different value when run. A parameter placeholder may be indicated by a colon (:) followed by a parameter name, or by a question mark (?) followed by an integer position. When the query is later executed, a value must be supplied for each parameter in the query, using the `setParameter` method. Specifying the query using the `@NamedQuery` annotation introduces an additional level of safety: the query must be a constant string literal, preventing construction by string concatenation, and the only way to fill in values for parts of the query is by setting positional parameters.\n\nIt is good practice to use prepared statements (in SQL) or query parameters (in the Java Persistence Query Language) for supplying parameter values to a query, whether or not any of the parameters are directly traceable to user input. Doing so avoids any need to worry about quoting and escaping.\n\n\n## Example\nIn the following example, the code runs a simple SQL query in two different ways.\n\nThe first way involves building a query, `query1`, by concatenating an environment variable with some string literals. The environment variable can include special characters, so this code allows for SQL injection attacks.\n\nThe second way, which shows good practice, involves building a query, `query2`, with a single string literal that includes a wildcard (`?`). The wildcard is then given a value by calling `setString`. This version is immune to injection attacks, because any special characters in the environment variable are not given any special treatment.\n\n\n```java\n{\n    // BAD: the category might have SQL special characters in it\n    String category = System.getenv(\"ITEM_CATEGORY\");\n    Statement statement = connection.createStatement();\n    String query1 = \"SELECT ITEM,PRICE FROM PRODUCT WHERE ITEM_CATEGORY='\"\n        + category + \"' ORDER BY PRICE\";\n    ResultSet results = statement.executeQuery(query1);\n}\n\n{\n    // GOOD: use a prepared query\n    String category = System.getenv(\"ITEM_CATEGORY\");\n    String query2 = \"SELECT ITEM,PRICE FROM PRODUCT WHERE ITEM_CATEGORY=? ORDER BY PRICE\";\n    PreparedStatement statement = connection.prepareStatement(query2);\n    statement.setString(1, category);\n    ResultSet results = statement.executeQuery();\n}\n```\n\n## Example\nThe following code shows several different ways to run a Java Persistence query.\n\nThe first example involves building a query, `query1`, by concatenating an environment variable with some string literals.

            "text" : "# Deserialization of user-controlled data\nDeserializing untrusted data using any deserialization framework that allows the construction of arbitrary serializable objects is easily exploitable and in many cases allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code. Even before a deserialized object is returned to the caller of a deserialization method a lot of code may have been executed, including static initializers, constructors, and finalizers. Automatic deserialization of fields means that an attacker may craft a nested combination of objects on which the executed initialization code may have unforeseen effects, such as the execution of arbitrary code.\n\nThere are many different serialization frameworks. This query currently supports Kryo, XmlDecoder, XStream, SnakeYaml, JYaml, JsonIO, YAMLBeans, HessianBurlap, Castor, Burlap, Jackson, Jabsorb, Jodd JSON, Flexjson, Gson and Java IO serialization through `ObjectInputStream`/`ObjectOutputStream`.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nAvoid deserialization of untrusted data if at all possible. If the architecture permits it then use other formats instead of serialized objects, for example JSON or XML.

            "markdown" : "# Deserialization of user-controlled data\nDeserializing untrusted data using any deserialization framework that allows the construction of arbitrary serializable objects is easily exploitable and in many cases allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code. Even before a deserialized object is returned to the caller of a deserialization method a lot of code may have been executed, including static initializers, constructors, and finalizers. Automatic deserialization of fields means that an attacker may craft a nested combination of objects on which the executed initialization code may have unforeseen effects, such as the execution of arbitrary code.\n\nThere are many different serialization frameworks. This query currently supports Kryo, XmlDecoder, XStream, SnakeYaml, JYaml, JsonIO, YAMLBeans, HessianBurlap, Castor, Burlap, Jackson, Jabsorb, Jodd JSON, Flexjson, Gson and Java IO serialization through `ObjectInputStream`/`ObjectOutputStream`.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nAvoid deserialization of untrusted data if at all possible. If the architecture permits it then use other formats instead of serialized objects, for example JSON or XML. However, these formats should not be deserialized into complex objects because this provides further opportunities for attack. For example, XML-based deserialization attacks are possible through libraries such as XStream and XmlDecoder.\n\nAlternatively, a tightly controlled whitelist can limit the vulnerability of code, but be aware of the existence of so-called Bypass Gadgets, which can circumvent such protection measures.\n\nRecommendations specific to particular frameworks supported by this query:\n\n**FastJson** - `com.alibaba:fastjson`\n\n* **Secure by Default**: Partially\n* **Recommendation**: Call `com.alibaba.fastjson.parser.ParserConfig#setSafeMode` with the argument `true` before deserializing untrusted data.\n\n\n**FasterXML** - `com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind`\n\n* **Secure by Default**: Yes\n* **Recommendation**: Don't call `com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper#enableDefaultTyping` and don't annotate any object fields with `com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonTypeInfo` passing either the `CLASS` or `MINIMAL_CLASS` values to the annotation.

If a JEXL expression is built using attacker-controlled data, and then evaluated, then it may allow the attacker to run arbitrary code.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nIt is generally recommended to avoid using untrusted input in a JEXL expression. If it is not possible, JEXL expressions should be run in a sandbox that allows accessing only explicitly allowed classes.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following example uses untrusted data to build and run a JEXL expression.\n\n\n```java\npublic void evaluate(Socket socket) throws IOException {\n  try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(\n        new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()))) {\n    \n    String input = reader.readLine();\n    JexlEngine jexl = new JexlBuilder().create();\n    JexlExpression expression = jexl.createExpression(input);\n    JexlContext context = new MapContext();\n    expression.evaluate(context);\n  }\n}\n```\nThe next example shows how an untrusted JEXL expression can be run in a sandbox that allows accessing only methods in the `java.lang.Math` class. The sandbox is implemented using `JexlSandbox` class that is provided by Apache Commons JEXL 3.\n\n\n```java\npublic void evaluate(Socket socket) throws IOException {\n  try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(\n        new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()))) {\n    \n    JexlSandbox onlyMath = new JexlSandbox(false);\n    onlyMath.white(\"java.lang.Math\");\n    JexlEngine jexl = new JexlBuilder().sandbox(onlyMath).create();\n      \n    String input = reader.readLine();\n    JexlExpression expression = jexl.createExpression(input);\n    JexlContext context = new MapContext();\n    expression.evaluate(context);\n  }\n}\n```\nThe next example shows another way how a sandbox can be implemented. It uses a custom implementation of `JexlUberspect` that checks if callees are instances of allowed classes.\n\n\n```java\npublic void evaluate(Socket socket) throws IOException {\n  try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(\n        new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()))) {\n    \n    JexlUberspect sandbox = new JexlUberspectSandbox();\n    JexlEngine jexl = new JexlBuilder().uberspect(sandbox).create();\n      \n    String input = reader.readLine();\n    JexlExpression expression = jexl.createExpression(input);\n    JexlContext context = new MapContext();\n    expression.evaluate(context);\n  }\n\n  private static class JexlUberspectSandbox implements JexlUberspect {\n\n    private static final List<String> ALLOWED_CLASSES =\n              Arrays.asList(\"java.lang.Math\", \"java.util.Random\");\n\n    private final JexlUberspect uberspect = new JexlBuilder().create().getUberspect();\n\n    private void checkAccess(Object obj) {\n      if (!ALLOWED_CLASSES.contains(obj.getClass().getCanonicalName())) {\n        throw new AccessControlException(\"Not allowed\");\n      }\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public JexlMethod getMethod(Object obj, String method, Object... args) {\n      checkAccess(obj);\n      return uberspect.getMethod(obj, method, args);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public List<PropertyResolver> getResolvers(JexlOperator op, Object obj) {\n      checkAccess(obj);\n      return uberspect.getResolvers(op, obj);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void setClassLoader(ClassLoader loader) {\n      uberspect.setClassLoader(loader);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public int getVersion() {\n      return uberspect.getVersion();\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public JexlMethod getConstructor(Object obj, Object... args) {\n      checkAccess(obj);\n      return uberspect.getConstructor(obj, args);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public JexlPropertyGet getPropertyGet(Object obj, Object identifier) {\n      checkAccess(obj);\n      return uberspect.getPropertyGet(obj, identifier);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public JexlPropertyGet getPropertyGet(List<PropertyResolver> resolvers, Object obj, Object identifier) {\n      checkAccess(obj);\n      return uberspect.getPropertyGet(resolvers, obj, identifier);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public JexlPropertySet getPropertySet(Object obj, Object identifier, Object arg) {\n      checkAccess(obj);\n      return uberspect.getPropertySet(obj, identifier, arg);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public JexlPropertySet getPropertySet(List<PropertyResolver> resolvers, Object obj, Object identifier, Object arg) {\n      checkAccess(obj);\n      return uberspect.getPropertySet(resolvers, obj, identifier, arg);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public Iterator<?> getIterator(Object obj) {\n      checkAccess(obj);\n      return uberspect.getIterator(obj);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public JexlArithmetic.Uberspect getArithmetic(JexlArithmetic arithmetic) {\n      return uberspect.getArithmetic(arithmetic);\n    } \n  }\n}\n```\n\n## References\n* Apache Commons JEXL: [Project page](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-jexl/).\n* Apache Commons JEXL documentation: [JEXL 2.1.1 API](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-jexl/javadocs/apidocs-2.1.1/).\n* Apache Commons JEXL documentation: [JEXL 3.1 API](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-jexl/apidocs/index.html).\n* OWASP: [Expression Language Injection](https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/Expression_Language_Injection).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-94](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/94.html).\n",

The sandbox is implemented using `JexlSandbox` class that is provided by Apache Commons JEXL 3.\n\n\n```java\npublic void evaluate(Socket socket) throws IOException {\n  try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(\n        new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()))) {\n    \n    JexlSandbox onlyMath = new JexlSandbox(false);\n    onlyMath.white(\"java.lang.Math\");\n    JexlEngine jexl = new JexlBuilder().sandbox(onlyMath).create();\n      \n    String input = reader.readLine();\n    JexlExpression expression = jexl.createExpression(input);\n    JexlContext context = new MapContext();\n    expression.evaluate(context);\n  }\n}\n```\nThe next example shows another way how a sandbox can be implemented. It uses a custom implementation of `JexlUberspect` that checks if callees are instances of allowed classes.\n\n\n```java\npublic void evaluate(Socket socket) throws IOException {\n  try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(\n        new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()))) {\n    \n    JexlUberspect sandbox = new JexlUberspectSandbox();\n    JexlEngine jexl = new JexlBuilder().uberspect(sandbox).create();\n      \n    String input = reader.readLine();\n    JexlExpression expression = jexl.createExpression(input);\n    JexlContext context = new MapContext();\n    expression.evaluate(context);\n  }\n\n  private static class JexlUberspectSandbox implements JexlUberspect {\n\n    private static final List<String> ALLOWED_CLASSES =\n              Arrays.asList(\"java.lang.Math\", \"java.util.Random\");\n\n    private final JexlUberspect uberspect = new JexlBuilder().create().getUberspect();\n\n    private void checkAccess(Object obj) {\n      if (!ALLOWED_CLASSES.contains(obj.getClass().getCanonicalName())) {\n        throw new AccessControlException(\"Not allowed\");\n      }\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public JexlMethod getMethod(Object obj, String method, Object... args) {\n      checkAccess(obj);\n      return uberspect.getMethod(obj, method, args);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public List<PropertyResolver> getResolvers(JexlOperator op, Object obj) {\n      checkAccess(obj);\n      return uberspect.getResolvers(op, obj);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void setClassLoader(ClassLoader loader) {\n      uberspect.setClassLoader(loader);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public int getVersion() {\n      return uberspect.getVersion();\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public JexlMethod getConstructor(Object obj, Object... args) {\n      checkAccess(obj);\n      return uberspect.getConstructor(obj, args);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public JexlPropertyGet getPropertyGet(Object obj, Object identifier) {\n      checkAccess(obj);\n      return uberspect.getPropertyGet(obj, identifier);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public JexlPropertyGet getPropertyGet(List<PropertyResolver> resolvers, Object obj, Object identifier) {\n      checkAccess(obj);\n      return uberspect.getPropertyGet(resolvers, obj, identifier);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public JexlPropertySet getPropertySet(Object obj, Object identifier, Object arg) {\n      checkAccess(obj);\n      return uberspect.getPropertySet(obj, identifier, arg);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public JexlPropertySet getPropertySet(List<PropertyResolver> resolvers, Object obj, Object identifier, Object arg) {\n      checkAccess(obj);\n      return uberspect.getPropertySet(resolvers, obj, identifier, arg);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public Iterator<?> getIterator(Object obj) {\n      checkAccess(obj);\n      return uberspect.getIterator(obj);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public JexlArithmetic.Uberspect getArithmetic(JexlArithmetic arithmetic) {\n      return uberspect.getArithmetic(arithmetic);\n    } \n  }\n}\n```\n\n## References\n* Apache Commons JEXL: [Project page](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-jexl/).\n* Apache Commons JEXL documentation: [JEXL 2.1.1 API](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-jexl/javadocs/apidocs-2.1.1/).\n* Apache Commons JEXL documentation: [JEXL 3.1 API](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-jexl/apidocs/index.html).\n* OWASP: [Expression Language Injection](https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/Expression_Language_Injection).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-94](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/94.html).\n"

Groovy's `SecureASTCustomizer` allows securing source code by controlling what code constructs are permitted. This is typically done when using Groovy for its scripting or domain specific language (DSL) features. The fundamental problem is that Groovy is a dynamic language, yet `SecureASTCustomizer` works by looking at Groovy AST statically.

If user input must be included in the expression, it should be then evaluated in a limited context that doesn't allow arbitrary method invocation.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following example uses untrusted data to build a SpEL expression and then runs it in the default powerful context.\n\n\n```java\npublic Object evaluate(Socket socket) throws IOException {\n  try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(\n      new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()))) {\n\n    String string = reader.readLine();\n    ExpressionParser parser = new SpelExpressionParser();\n    Expression expression = parser.parseExpression(string);\n    return expression.getValue();\n  }\n}\n```\nThe next example shows how an untrusted SpEL expression can be run in `SimpleEvaluationContext` that doesn't allow accessing arbitrary methods. However, it's recommended to avoid using untrusted input in SpEL expressions.\n\n\n```java\npublic Object evaluate(Socket socket) throws IOException {\n  try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(\n      new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()))) {\n\n    String string = reader.readLine();\n    ExpressionParser parser = new SpelExpressionParser();\n    Expression expression = parser.parseExpression(string);\n    SimpleEvaluationContext context \n        = SimpleEvaluationContext.forReadWriteDataBinding().build();\n    return expression.getValue(context);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## References\n* Spring Framework Reference Documentation: [Spring Expression Language (SpEL)](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/4.2.x/spring-framework-reference/html/expressions.html).\n* OWASP: [Expression Language Injection](https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/Expression_Language_Injection).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-94](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/94.html).\n"

They show an example of XPath injection and one method of preventing it.\n\n\n```java\nfinal String xmlStr = \"<users>\" + \n                        \"   <user name=\\\"aaa\\\" pass=\\\"pass1\\\"></user>\" + \n                        \"   <user name=\\\"bbb\\\" pass=\\\"pass2\\\"></user>\" + \n                        \"</users>\";\ntry {\n    DocumentBuilderFactory domFactory = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();\n    domFactory.setNamespaceAware(true);\n    DocumentBuilder builder = domFactory.newDocumentBuilder();\n    //Document doc = builder.parse(\"user.xml\");\n    Document doc = builder.parse(new InputSource(new StringReader(xmlStr)));\n\n    XPathFactory factory = XPathFactory.newInstance();\n    XPath xpath = factory.newXPath();\n\n    // Injectable data\n    String user = request.getParameter(\"user\");\n    String pass = request.getParameter(\"pass\");\n    if (user != null && pass != null) {\n        boolean isExist = false;\n\n        // Bad expression\n        String expression1 = \"/users/user[@name='\" + user + \"' and @pass='\" + pass + \"']\";\n        isExist = (boolean)xpath.evaluate(expression1, doc, XPathConstants.BOOLEAN);\n        System.out.println(isExist);\n\n        // Bad expression\n        XPathExpression expression2 = xpath.compile(\"/users/user[@name='\" + user + \"' and @pass='\" + pass + \"']\");\n        isExist = (boolean)expression2.evaluate(doc, XPathConstants.BOOLEAN);\n        System.out.println(isExist);\n\n        // Bad expression\n        StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer(\"/users/user[@name=\");\n        sb.append(user);\n        sb.append(\"' and @pass='\");\n        sb.append(pass);\n        sb.append(\"']\");\n        String query = sb.toString();\n        XPathExpression expression3 = xpath.compile(query);\n        isExist = (boolean)expression3.evaluate(doc, XPathConstants.BOOLEAN);\n        System.out.println(isExist);\n\n        // Good expression\n        String expression4 = \"/users/user[@name=$user and @pass=$pass]\";\n        xpath.setXPathVariableResolver(v -> {\n        switch (v.getLocalPart()) {\n            case \"user\":\n                return user;\n            case \"pass\":\n                return pass;\n            default:\n                throw new IllegalArgumentException();\n            }\n        });\n        isExist = (boolean)xpath.evaluate(expression4, doc, XPathConstants.BOOLEAN);\n        System.out.println(isExist);\n\n\n        // Bad Dom4j \n        org.dom4j.io.SAXReader reader = new org.dom4j.io.SAXReader();\n        org.dom4j.Document document = reader.read(new InputSource(new StringReader(xmlStr)));\n        isExist = document.selectSingleNode(\"/users/user[@name='\" + user + \"' and @pass='\" + pass + \"']\") != null;\n        // or document.selectNodes\n        System.out.println(isExist);\n\n        // Good Dom4j\n        org.jaxen.SimpleVariableContext svc = new org.jaxen.SimpleVariableContext();\n        svc.setVariableValue(\"user\", user);\n        svc.setVariableValue(\"pass\", pass);\n        String xpathString = \"/users/user[@name=$user and @pass=$pass]\";\n        org.dom4j.XPath safeXPath = document.createXPath(xpathString);\n        safeXPath.setVariableContext(svc);\n        isExist = safeXPath.selectSingleNode(document) != null;\n        System.out.println(isExist);\n    }\n} catch (ParserConfigurationException e) {\n\n} catch (SAXException e) {\n\n} catch (XPathExpressionException e) {\n\n} catch (org.dom4j.DocumentException e) {\n\n}\n```\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [Testing for XPath Injection](https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/07-Input_Validation_Testing/09-Testing_for_XPath_Injection).\n* OWASP: [XPath Injection](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/XPATH_Injection).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-643](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/643.html).\n"

If user-provided stylesheets must be processed, enable the secure processing mode.\n\n\n## Example\nIn the following examples, the code accepts an XSLT stylesheet from the user and processes it.\n\nIn the first example, the user-provided XSLT stylesheet is parsed and processed.\n\nIn the second example, secure processing mode is enabled.\n\n\n```java\nimport javax.xml.XMLConstants;\nimport javax.xml.transform.TransformerFactory;\nimport javax.xml.transform.stream.StreamResult;\nimport javax.xml.transform.stream.StreamSource;\n\npublic void transform(Socket socket, String inputXml) throws Exception {\n  StreamSource xslt = new StreamSource(socket.getInputStream());\n  StreamSource xml = new StreamSource(new StringReader(inputXml));\n  StringWriter result = new StringWriter();\n  TransformerFactory factory = TransformerFactory.newInstance();\n\n  // BAD: User provided XSLT stylesheet is processed\n  factory.newTransformer(xslt).transform(xml, new StreamResult(result));\n\n  // GOOD: The secure processing mode is enabled\n  factory.setFeature(XMLConstants.FEATURE_SECURE_PROCESSING, true);\n  factory.newTransformer(xslt).transform(xml, new StreamResult(result));\n}  \n```\n\n## References\n* Wikipedia: [XSLT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XSLT).\n* The Java Tutorials: [Transforming XML Data with XSLT](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jaxp/xslt/transformingXML.html).\n* [XSLT Injection Basics](https://blog.hunniccyber.com/ektron-cms-remote-code-execution-xslt-transform-injection-java/).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-74](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/74.html).\n"

            "text" : "# LDAP query built from user-controlled sources\nIf an LDAP query is built using string concatenation, and the components of the concatenation include user input, a user is likely to be able to run malicious LDAP queries.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nIf user input must be included in an LDAP query, it should be escaped to avoid a malicious user providing special characters that change the meaning of the query. If possible build the LDAP query using framework helper methods, for example from Spring's `LdapQueryBuilder` and `LdapNameBuilder`, instead of string concatenation. Alternatively, escape user input using an appropriate LDAP encoding method, for example: `encodeForLDAP` or `encodeForDN` from OWASP ESAPI, `LdapEncoder.filterEncode` or `LdapEncoder.nameEncode` from Spring LDAP, or `Filter.encodeValue` from UnboundID library.\n\n\n## Example\nIn the following examples, the code accepts an \"organization name\" and a \"username\" from the user, which it uses to query LDAP.\n\nThe first example concatenates the unvalidated and unencoded user input directly into both the DN (Distinguished Name) and the search filter used for the LDAP query. A malicious user could provide special characters to change the meaning of these queries, and search for a completely different set of values. The LDAP query is executed using Java JNDI API.\n\nThe second example uses the OWASP ESAPI library to encode the user values before they are included in the DN and search filters.

            "markdown" : "# LDAP query built from user-controlled sources\nIf an LDAP query is built using string concatenation, and the components of the concatenation include user input, a user is likely to be able to run malicious LDAP queries.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nIf user input must be included in an LDAP query, it should be escaped to avoid a malicious user providing special characters that change the meaning of the query. If possible build the LDAP query using framework helper methods, for example from Spring's `LdapQueryBuilder` and `LdapNameBuilder`, instead of string concatenation. Alternatively, escape user input using an appropriate LDAP encoding method, for example: `encodeForLDAP` or `encodeForDN` from OWASP ESAPI, `LdapEncoder.filterEncode` or `LdapEncoder.nameEncode` from Spring LDAP, or `Filter.encodeValue` from UnboundID library.\n\n\n## Example\nIn the following examples, the code accepts an \"organization name\" and a \"username\" from the user, which it uses to query LDAP.\n\nThe first example concatenates the unvalidated and unencoded user input directly into both the DN (Distinguished Name) and the search filter used for the LDAP query. A malicious user could provide special characters to change the meaning of these queries, and search for a completely different set of values. The LDAP query is executed using Java JNDI API.\n\nThe second example uses the OWASP ESAPI library to encode the user values before they are included in the DN and search filters. This ensures the meaning of the query cannot be changed by a malicious user.\n\n\n```java\nimport javax.naming.directory.DirContext;\nimport org.owasp.esapi.Encoder;\nimport org.owasp.esapi.reference.DefaultEncoder;\n\npublic void ldapQueryBad(HttpServletRequest request, DirContext ctx) throws NamingException {\n  String organizationName = request.getParameter(\"organization_name\");\n  String username = request.getParameter(\"username\");\n\n  // BAD: User input used in DN (Distinguished Name) without encoding\n  String dn = \"OU=People,O=\" + organizationName;\n\n  // BAD: User input used in search filter without encoding\n  String filter = \"username=\" + userName;\n\n  ctx.search(dn, filter, new SearchControls());\n}\n\npublic void ldapQueryGood(HttpServletRequest request, DirContext ctx) throws NamingException {\n  String organizationName = request.getParameter(\"organization_name\");\n  String username = request.getParameter(\"username\");\n\n  // ESAPI encoder\n  Encoder encoder = DefaultEncoder.getInstance();\n\n  // GOOD: Organization name is encoded before being used in DN\n  String safeOrganizationName = encoder.encodeForDN(organizationName);\n  String safeDn = \"OU=People,O=\" + safeOrganizationName;\n\n  // GOOD: User input is encoded before being used in search filter\n  String safeUsername = encoder.encodeForLDAP(username);\n  String safeFilter = \"username=\" + safeUsername;\n  \n  ctx.search(safeDn, safeFilter, new SearchControls());\n}\n```\nThe third example uses Spring `LdapQueryBuilder` to build an LDAP query.

Ideally, follow these rules:\n\n* Do not allow more than a single \".\" character.\n* Do not allow directory separators such as \"/\" or \"\\\\\" (depending on the file system).\n* Do not rely on simply replacing problematic sequences such as \"../\". For example, after applying this filter to \".../...//\" the resulting string would still be \"../\".\n* Ideally use a whitelist of known good patterns.\n\n## Example\nIn this example, a file name is read from a `java.net.Socket` and then used to access a file in the user's home directory and send it back over the socket.

            "markdown" : "# Uncontrolled data used in path expression\nAccessing paths controlled by users can allow an attacker to access unexpected resources. This can result in sensitive information being revealed or deleted, or an attacker being able to influence behavior by modifying unexpected files.\n\nPaths that are naively constructed from data controlled by a user may contain unexpected special characters, such as \"..\". Such a path may potentially point to any directory on the file system.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nValidate user input before using it to construct a file path. Ideally, follow these rules:\n\n* Do not allow more than a single \".\" character.\n* Do not allow directory separators such as \"/\" or \"\\\\\" (depending on the file system).\n* Do not rely on simply replacing problematic sequences such as \"../\". For example, after applying this filter to \".../...//\" the resulting string would still be \"../\".\n* Ideally use a whitelist of known good patterns.\n\n## Example\nIn this example, a file name is read from a `java.net.Socket` and then used to access a file in the user's home directory and send it back over the socket. However, a malicious user could enter a file name which contains special characters. For example, the string \"../../etc/passwd\" will result in the code reading the file located at \"/home/\\[user\\]/../../etc/passwd\", which is the system's password file.
